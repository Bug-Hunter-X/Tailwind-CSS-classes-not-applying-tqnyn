```javascript
//Ensure that you've configured your PostCSS properly. The PostCSS configuration file (usually `postcss.config.js` or equivalent) should include the Tailwind CSS plugin.
//In your PostCSS config file
module.exports = {
  plugins: {
    tailwindcss: {},
    autoprefixer: {},
  },
};
//Make sure you import the generated CSS file into your main application file (usually `index.js`, `main.js`, or equivalent).
//In your main application file
@tailwind base;
@tailwind components;
@tailwind utilities;
//Verify that the paths to the tailwind files and config file are correct in your configuration and application files.
//Check for any typos in the CSS class names in your HTML.
//Check for any CSS conflicts where the Tailwind classes are being overridden. 
//Check for any conflicting styles which may be hiding the tailwind classes.
