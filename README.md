# Tailwind CSS Classes Not Applying Bug

This repository demonstrates a common bug encountered when using Tailwind CSS: classes not being applied to elements.  The issue occurs even when Tailwind appears to be correctly installed and configured.

## Bug Description:

Despite correctly setting up Tailwind CSS (including the PostCSS configuration, importing the CSS file, etc.), the classes defined in `tailwind.config.js` don't seem to affect the rendered HTML.

## How to reproduce:

1. Clone this repository.
2. Install dependencies using `npm install`.
3. Run a development server (e.g., using Vite or Next.js).
4. Observe that the `bg-gray-100`, `p-4`, `text-3xl`, `font-bold`, and `underline` classes are not applied to the h1 element.

## Solution:

The solution involves verifying several steps in your Tailwind and application configuration.
